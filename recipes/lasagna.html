        <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>
      <p>
        Ingredients
        pound sweet Italian sausage
        ¾ pound lean ground beef        
        ½ cup minced onion        
        2 cloves garlic, crushed        
        1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
        2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce        
        2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste        
        ½ cup water        
        2 tablespoons white sugar        
        4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided        
        1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves        
        1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste        
        1 teaspoon Italian seasoning        
        ½ teaspoon fennel seeds        
        ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper        
        12 lasagna noodles        
        16 ounces ricotta cheese        
        1 egg        
        ¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced        
        ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese
      </p>
      <p>
        Directions
        Step 1
        Gather all your ingredients.
        Step 2
        Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
        Step 3
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
        Step 4
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
        Step 5
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        Step 6
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        Step 7
        To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
        Step 8
        Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        Step 9
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
        Step 10
        Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
